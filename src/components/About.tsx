        A self-taught web developer with an electrical technology degree,
        Despite my initial path, I discovered my passion for web development
        through self-learning. Proficient in front-end technologies like
        JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as popular frameworks Vue.js and
        React.js. My unique journey enhances my creativity and resourcefulness
        in overcoming challenges. Excited about the endless opportunities for
        growth in this dynamic field.
